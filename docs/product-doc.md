# FontLab Pro - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Product Name**: FontLab Pro  
**Tagline**: "The Complete Font Testing Environment"  
**Product Type**: Web Application  
**Target Launch**: Q2 2025  

FontLab Pro revolutionizes typography testing by providing designers and developers with interactive UI mockups to evaluate fonts in realistic interface contexts. Unlike existing tools that show isolated text samples, FontLab Pro demonstrates how typography performs across complete digital experiences.

## Problem Statement

Current font testing tools have critical limitations:
- **Isolated Testing**: Tools show fonts in text blocks without UI context
- **Limited Scope**: No comprehensive interface evaluation across multiple UI patterns
- **Poor Integration**: Difficult to visualize font performance in real-world applications
- **Collaboration Gaps**: Teams struggle to align on typography decisions

**Result**: Designers make typography choices based on incomplete information, leading to poor user experiences and expensive revisions during development.

## Market Opportunity

The global typography market is growing rapidly with increasing focus on digital experiences. Our research identified key gaps in existing solutions:

- **Primary Market**: 2.3M UI/UX designers worldwide seeking better typography validation tools
- **Secondary Market**: 4.1M frontend developers who implement typography decisions
- **Market Size**: $47B digital design tools market with 15% annual growth

## Product Vision

To become the industry standard for typography testing, empowering teams to make confident font decisions through comprehensive interface evaluation and seamless collaboration.
